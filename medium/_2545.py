# There is a class with m students and n exams. 
# You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix score, where each row represents one student and score[i][j] denotes the score the ith student got in the jth exam. 
# The matrix score contains distinct integers only.

# You are also given an integer k. Sort the students (i.e., the rows of the matrix) by their scores in the kthÂ (0-indexed) exam from the highest to the lowest.

# Return the matrix after sorting it.
